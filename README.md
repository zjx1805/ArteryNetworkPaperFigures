(a) Comparison between simulated pressure and pressure from ADAN on a node-by-node basis with respect to the graph level. Terminating pressures in the simulation are set to be the same as those in the ADAN result. (b) The relationship between pressure from the ADAN result at each node with respect to its path length. It remains an open question as of why there is such a strong relationship between them. (c) Simulated pressure for compartment LMCA for each node with respect to graph level and path length.
